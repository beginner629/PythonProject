A.K.A Mr Lyan, international cocktail expert

We're mid <a href="http://www.londonwineweek.com/" target="_hplink">Wine Week</a> here in London, and there's been a host of amazing events, tastings and tours afoot. These vary from beginner classes to events for the true geek to er, really geek out on. Plus there's the opportunity to engage with the events that surround this, including <a href="http://www.rawfair.com/" target="_hplink">RAW</a> where there was the opportunity to understand the growing category of natural wines.

It's a great week all in all, and I've loved it over the years for helping me explore and learn. Of course I love a glass of wine, but also, wine offers an interesting category of flavours and textures that I've grown more interested in putting into cocktails.

This becomes more the case when the sun starts to creep out (very slowly it seems over the last few weeks...) and I want lighter cocktails to enjoy with friends; As more occasions to get together outside with some good food and drink rises with the weather, I find myself reaching for some wine cocktails more frequently. Wine is of course a great partner for food, and much as I do when I'm pairing with a dish, I love being able to adapt the various flavours and weights of my drinks to make sure the two intertwine seamlessly. Using a wine in a cocktail allows me to use its breadth of flavours but be able to adapt these and the texture to match the dish.

Here are some of my favourite wines to use in cocktails:

<u><a href="http://www.tiopepe.co.uk/" target="_hplink">Tio Pepe</a> Fino/<a href="http://www.waitrose.com/shop/ProductView-10317-10001-32507-Hidalgo+La+Gitana+Manzanilla" target="_hplink">La Gitana</a> Manzanilla</u>

Although in the boozier class of wine, these bone dry Spanish exports have long been favourites and I tend to always have a fresh bottle in the fridge. They're a little more forgiving with timing than your average white wine (although they're great to cook with, and stellar drunk by themselves, so they don't last long!) and give an amazing depth to aperitif cocktails. Tio Pepe's ultra-dry, green olive notes and La Gitana's coastal-licked salinity need some scant herbal or fruity touches, and a little bite on the side and you're set for an early evening. 

<u>Mas Amiel Maury</u>

<u>Orange Wine</u>

This is quite a divisive category of wine that relies on extra skin contact to bring a drying tannin and a distinct funk. Some of the amphora-aged orange wines from Georgia I've had have been amazing, but this <a href="http://www.dynamicvines.com/producer/radikon" target="_hplink">Slovenian example</a> formed the base of an 'Orange Wine Vermouth' that I paired with some Campari and soda for a great twist on one of my favourite light, aperitif hi-balls - the Americano:

Add all to a microwave safe container, cover, and blast on full power for three minutes, allow to cool, then strain:

<em>Orange Vermouth</em>

<strong>To serve:</strong>

Build over ice and top with soda and garnish with a slice of orange:

<strong>On the Road - Jack Kerouac</strong>

<em><strong>"Because he had no place he could stay in without getting tired of it and because there was nowhere to go but everywhere, keep rolling under the stars..."</strong></em>

On the Road is the quintessential travel novel and explores the post war generation and their counterculture behaviour. The characters feed off adventure and are carefree while exploring America. It's a perfect novel for anyone wanting to explore North America as its vivid tales and depictive scenes will leave you wondering what you could become and maybe allow you to live out the fantasy of the 'American Dream'. It's a story for nomad's and will leave you with wonder and a spark of wanderlust. 

<strong>The Beach - Alex Garland</strong>

<a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-20-1432136121-6422959-Maya_Bay1.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-20-1432136121-6422959-Maya_Bay1.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-20-1432136121-6422959-Maya_Bay1-thumb.jpg" width="570" height="376" /></a>

<em><strong>"If I'd learnt one thing from travelling, it was that the way to get things done was to go ahead and do them. Don't talk about going to Borneo. Book a ticket, get a visa, pack a bag, and it just happens."</strong></em>

Another famous tale of backpackers and a quest for finding something different in a world full of normality. The novel plays off the mystery of the map given to the protagonist at the beginning and the subsequent journey it takes to get to the beach. Anyone wanting to visit Thailand will surely know about where the movie version is set Ko Phi Phi Lee and be yearning to have a moment in paradise. This novel will entice you with its mystery and implore you to explore the wonders of Thailand. It's tempting to visit Thailand just for the mystery of it all, but if a stranger hands you a map to an unknown location it's probably a good idea to turn around and walk the other way.

<strong>Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail - Cheryl Strayed</strong>

<a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-20-1432136254-2436639-7714611878_08fdf4a08f_k.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-20-1432136254-2436639-7714611878_08fdf4a08f_k.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-20-1432136254-2436639-7714611878_08fdf4a08f_k-thumb.jpg" width="570" height="379" /></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/raybouk/7714611878" target="_hplink">Ray Bouknight</a>

<em><strong>"It only had to do with how it felt to be in the wild. With what it was like to walk for miles for no reason other than to witness the accumulation of trees and meadows, mountains and deserts, streams and rocks, rivers and grasses, sunrises and sunsets. The experience was powerful and fundamental."</strong></em>

Wild is a story of self-exploration and healing, Cheryl Strayed whom lost her mother hiked the Pacific Crest Trail one of the toughest trails in the world. It is from the Mexican border to the Canadian border, you trek through hot desserts to snowy peaks. The story is great for the visualisation of the trail and leaves you wanting to see the incredible wildlife and be completely sequestered in nature. You also get to go through her emotional journey and realise the power of nature and how travelling, trekking and exploring the world can change your whole perspective.

<em><strong>"The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun."</strong></em>

Christopher McCandless decided to travel the Alaskan wilderness and went with little supplies; he was looking to live a lifestyle disconnected from the modern world and its hectic vibe. He kept a journal and his mission in the wild led to his demise. He's body was discovered and it was determined that he died of starvation. It's obviously important to have supplies and know where your next meal is coming from. But it's also important to discover a completely different world where the wilderness roams free; you find out new things about yourself. That is the point of travelling, and into the wild expresses that desire very well. This is an excellent book for a unique exploration into an unknown world.

<strong>Books can help you reach places you never thought you would and allow your imagination to run free. These stories can also inspire you to get out there and explore a place you've always wanted to visit, lose yourself in the culture of a new destination and its people. Keep exploring and satiating your wanderlust and discover new things about you through travelling.</strong>

Author and blogger battling two chronic diseases while maintaining a positive attitude and sense of humor

I always say that good health is a precious gift, not to be taken for granted. Living with illness makes one look at life in a different way. Receiving the diagnosis of any chronic long term illness can be earth shattering, and a shock to the system. It may take some time to process this new information that is clearly going to seriously change your life, and that of your family. You may possibly feel relief to finally know what has been troubling you for so long. Being able to put a name tag, as it were, to the ill health package you've been handed in life, at least gives you something to tackle and a plan of action can be implemented, instead of wandering around aimlessly in the dark. For some the journey to diagnosis can be an agonisingly long one, interspersed with countless tests and dashed hopes.

Every caregiver needs "time out" and an activity or hobby which is outside the confines of the home and is solely theirs, is essential for good mental health. Taking regular breaks from the daily pressures to recharge those internal batteries is vital for his/her emotional and physical well-being, which enables the caregiver to continue taking care of a loved one.

Television reporter for ITV News and ITV News London.

As I walk into the supermarket my eyes flit across various magazines bursting off the shelves. In their electric pink jackets with neon yellow lettering, they seem to bray at me, "Extra! Extra! This month's contribution to the body image public health crisis includes": 

I leave the shop and a double decker bus rolls past. Plastering its side is the gargantuan image of a topless woman, coquettishly hiding her breasts. It's an advert for black tights. I log on to Facebook. A Buzzfeed article about exam stress uses a picture of a young girl frowning into her cleavage, apparently her low-cut top is relevant to the pressures of making the grade. So, when I log on to Twitter and see people apoplectic over an advert of a woman in a bright yellow bikini, with the tag line "Are you beach body ready?", I applaud the outrage, but question why and how it's different to everything I've described above.

The Protein Plus advert was hard sell. Unashamed in its pursuit of profit, uninterested in its negative impact on womens sense of self-worth. Its brash nature helped to stir indignance; but the soft-sell stuff deserves a portion of our fury too. The constant stream of material; so damaging to young girls and womens confidence; is everywhere. Look around. It's been a few weeks since the #TakeBackTheBeach protest in Hyde Park. The mindless silence of status-quo hangs over the "fight" against unrealistic representations of the female form. Why should we wait for another yellow bikini moment to remind us that this is a problem we desperately need to dismember? It's great that leaked pictures of Cindy Crawford sans photoshop get us chatting on social media for a day and a half, but what's the point in shouting about a problem <em>only</em> when the arrow fired hits us right between the eyes. 

According to Girl Guiding UK, 87 per cent of girls aged 11-21 think that women are judged more on their appearance than ability. A coalition government report showed women's body satisfaction doesn't improve as they move toward and into midlife; indeed; a 45 year old woman is as likely to be dissatisfied with her appearance as her 19 year old daughter. Here are some depressing statistics from a <a href="http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/24438/1/CAR%20Costing%20the%20Invisible%20-%20final%20web.pdf" target="_hplink">report</a> examining the link between body confidence and aspirations in education and the workplace:

You can't unsee an image and that's why I think there's still a responsibility on retailers and advertisers to think about the diversity of the images that they're portraying and that they're not just promoting one ideal of the way to look and anyone who doesn't meet that is somehow a failure.

An issue this complex and interwoven in the fabric of society needs action across the board, from grass roots to governments... Media literacy education is an important part of this and must help young people today to not only be savvy consumers of media but conscious publishers of their own as well. 

The Body Confidence campaign encouraged schools to download a toolkit developed by the eating disorders charity Beat and a doctor from the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College. If you're a teacher, a youth team leader, a parent, a big sister, a big brother... click on this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/370677/Body_image_final_17.10.14.pdf" target="_hplink">link</a>. Put its contents to the test. The activities section suggests deconstructing images in the media. It pushes young people to analyse their actions on social media objectively. It makes them question themselves: how do I feel when I see images of perfection? Am I comparing myself to others? Another campaign, All Walks Beyond the Catwalk, has introduced body diversity to fashion modules. Our designers of the future are being taught to cut patterns to fit realistic body sizes. HURRAH! This is the type of action we need.

Presenter, DJ & Creator of IAmMusic.TV & IAmMusic Artists

When it comes to being healthy there are so many do's, don't and dieting extremes that the Internet becomes a Pandora's box of fitness contradictions. This year I decided that I wanted to see in the summer feeling healthy not only physically but mentally too. Giving myself an intense three-month personal boot camp I decided that my diet would be an essential place to start. Step forward Gareth Nicholas from MaxiNutrition who agreed to give his opinion on some of the fitness worlds most burning questions...

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day! We've heard this so many times but why? Getting your breakfast right is really important, start as you mean to go on but it really depends on what your goal is. Personally I'm a big fan of porridge with some berries, first it tastes great but most importantly it contains all three macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein and fat) in an appropriate balance.

<em><strong>How much water should you drink on a daily basis?</strong></em>

So many people start and fail. The best way to give yourself a chance is to set some goals. Goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time-bound, exciting and recorded. To make it work you need to make lifestyle changes but changes you can stick to. Allow yourself a treat now and again, it won't ruin your plan, on the contrary it will support it. Take it day by day and where possible make it enjoyable.

Dad, Photographer, Naturalist and Blogger

Depression and other mental health issues are often talked about in terms of spotting it and treating it, and we relate experiences and how we got help etc. but seldom have I seen anything written about how depression feels to a sufferer, so that is what I hope to show you.

<strong>How Depression Feels</strong>

It is not an easy thing to explain how depression feels, try and explain how happiness feels, it's not simple is it? well this is no different but please bare with me while I try. I should say this is how depression feels to me, as i cannot speak for you or anyone else really.

Anyway this is my story...

Every day felt like waking up and feeling a weight pressing down on me, pinning me to the bed, it became like a large black dog lying across my chest, I would struggle to eventually lift it enough to swing my legs over the edge of the bed, and rise to a standing position, but the weight remained, pushing down on my chest, on my shoulders, on my neck, and it stayed with me all day, every step a chore, every breath an effort, this is how I felt day in day out for more years than I can remember.

But it is not the only part of my of how depression feels.

Added to the heavy weight from the black dog, is the bleakness of the weather that surrounded me, the sun may be shining, kids are running around in shorts, laughing in gay abandon, but it's always raining in my head. The beauty of nature, of family, of friendship is coloured grey by the thoughts that seep into every event and action. Thoughts of decay, of jealousy, of worthlessness, feelings of inadequacy combined with self loathing and a lack of confidence tarnish every day interactions.

<strong>The Tiredness</strong>

One of the hardest elements to deal with when suffering is the constant, unyielding, insatiable tiredness that you feel, I could have slept for days and still have felt shattered. Partly because the cocoon of your bed is a safe haven, somewhere you can be you and not have to keep up any charade, but also partly because carrying the weight and mood described above wears you down, it claws at your muscles, drains what little mental strength you have left and leaves your shell like mind more worn out than you can easily imagine.

The cruelest irony of how depression feels though is that however tired and worn down you are, sleep is often hard to come by. You can be so worn out that you crumple into bed, but your mind remains too alert to allow sleep to come to you.

<strong>Hiding the Truth</strong>

Something non sufferers may not realise is that It is very easy for those of us who suffer to hide what is really happening, very easy indeed. Often the loudest person you know will be the one who struggles the most, an outward appearance is easy to fake, especially in short bursts, but it becomes tiring, which leads to wanting to hide away more, or sleep more.

Depression feels different to all us sufferers I'm sure, but it is a horrid illness that those who have not suffered will never quite understand, but maybe this will allow you to feel a little sympathy if you cannot find empathy.

This is in support of Mental Health Awareness Week.

Qualified RYT-200 UK Alliance yoga teacher

The first time I ever tried Yin yoga was about a year ago. I'd never even heard of it before I went on a yoga/fitness retreat where the teacher got us to lie in long held, static stretches for up to five minutes at a time. Five minutes of lying in one position might sound like it's totally relaxing and sleep inducing but in actual fact all the time you're fighting this mental battle to not fidget and shift your position as you reach your "edge". Sometimes you're fighting the urge to cry and you're constantly having to have a word with yourself not to come out of the posture early, telling yourself that if everyone else can stay in it, you can too. How long can five minutes really be?

I've just painted a really bad picture of Yin Yoga. In actual fact it's one of my favourite styles to practice. As oppose to restorative yoga where although very relaxing and I just feel like I'm falling asleep (that sunbed sleep where you realise you've just started dribbling) in Yin I find it a more conscious practice that allows your body to get into a really deep and intense stretch. You have to really focus on your breath leading you into a meditative state and you will the teacher to keep on talking to you throughout, as silence means one thing...that you focus on how uncomfortable you actually are. I always come out of it feeling slightly dazed but in a good way, coming out a lot lighter than when I went in.

Yin yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga (as oppose to yang which is more physical) where you hold a posture for anything from 3 minutes (deemed the minimum time) to 20 minutes (if you're a bit more of a pro) whilst at the same time cultivating inner stillness.

The majority of the poses are floor based and focus primarily on the lower part of the body (hips, pelvis, inner thighs, lower spine). The aim of holding the postures for so long is to access the deeper tissues such as the connective tissue and fascia, which account for about fifty percent of the resistance against the body's flexibility. It increases both mental and physical flexibility as well as stabilising the flow of energy through the body and is a great way to balance out a more dynamic yoga practice.

Within each posture you move to a place called the "edge" where you feel a manageable amount of sensation. It shouldn't be "painful" but depending on the posture sometimes it's not all that comfortable either. When this is reached the musculature around the point of focus starts to relax in the static hold and fluidity is increased in the tissues and joints, promoting flexibility and suppleness.

It was popularised by Paul Grilley and Sarah Powers who developed it from Taoist yoga and is not intended as a complete practice in itself, but more to compliment other forms of yang yoga and intense physical exercise. It often encompasses props, from straps and blocks to bolsters and sand bags (one of which was trying to pin down my hugely tight shoulder the other day) and in an average class you may get into around 6-8 different postures.

When on my yoga TTC we did Yin yoga regularly. It was always my favourite class allowing me time to think and go into myself whilst at the same time feeling as though you are really opening up your body. Maybe it's also because I never have to move off the floor!

If you haven't ever tried Yin yoga before, I'd highly recommend it, especially if you are someone who does high-intensity sport and don't normally balance this out with stretching enough. It tends to take place on an evening as you do feel pretty relaxed after it and for me is the perfect way to end a weekend, feeling like you've finished up doing something good for your body but without having to do anything too physical.

One of the UK's most sought after personal trainers and owner of West London personal training gym W10 Performance

We'd all like to be speedier in our given sport and perhaps you're frustrated because, despite your efforts, it doesn't seem to be happening?

Want to be faster? Just follow these simple rules:

<strong>GET STRONGER</strong>

The stronger and more explosive you are, the more force you'll generate, and the faster you'll be. Strength training in the gym, coupled with some plyometric (jumping) exercises, is essential if you want to get faster. Don't be afraid to lift some heavier weights - try a weight you can lift for five to eight reps per set, as this is will help you see the biggest strength gains initially.

<strong>BECOME LEANER</strong>

The heavier you are, the more difficult it is to move quickly, so decreasing your body fat is one of the quickest and easiest ways to improve your speed. What you eat will have the biggest impact here, so you need to be sure that you're eating for your specific requirements. This will be different for us all, so recording what you eat and finding a way to track your body composition on a regular basis can be very useful to help keep you on track.

<strong>IMPROVE YOUR POSTURE</strong>

Structural balance and good posture play a big part, not only in keeping you injury free, but also in helping you move and breathe more efficiently. And the more efficient you are in both of these areas, the faster you'll be. Typical areas of weakness that need attention are the hip flexors, hamstrings, glutes and lower- and mid-back, which can be improved through exercises such as lunges, deadlifts and rowing variations.

<strong>WORK ON TECHNIQUE</strong>

The more proficient you become in certain movement patterns, the more efficient your body will be and the faster you'll go. Want to get faster at running? Working on the technical aspects of running mechanics, such as stride length and arm drive, will make a huge difference to your efficiency, and in turn, your speed. To improve your stride length for example, you need to think about driving your leg back to push you forward.

<strong>DO SHORT SPRINTS</strong>

Performing short sprint intervals and improving technique are the quickest ways to improve speed. You need a good base of overall conditioning and to be as strong and lean as possible, but once you have a good level of general fitness, you need to sprint if you want to go faster. Start with shorter distances of, say 10-30m, and get complete rest between sets.

Journo, press relations, and not your typical "angry black female"

That's it.  No more.  I've decided a clean break is for the best.  Like a failed relationship, I've experienced the anger, the sorrow, the resignation, and now accept there's no going back.  I'm never going to be a runner.  

At first, I felt like a bit of a failure - like someone who never made it into an exclusive club, an inner sanctum of 10k-ers, half-marathon-ers and even people who've successfully managed to keep putting one foot in front of the other for that sacred 26.2 miles of a full marathon.

It's not for lack of motivation or desire.  I'm not particularly unfit.  I regularly walk 4-5 kilometres (up to 3 miles) on a bad day and cover this distance at least 4 times a week.  What many would call a "leisurely stroll" is a crawl to me.  Over the years, I've been told many times to "slow down" when walking alongside someone.  My natural pace is so brisk that it even puts some people off accompanying me (I put my speed walking down to a general character flaw - impatience).  Most of the time when I have to decrease my natural pace, it feels like torture - my gait is altered (though probably just in my head) and I feel as if I'm walking in slow-motion like in the movies (definitely in my head).

Of course, walking isn't the same as running and being good at one is no guarantee of being good at the other.  But I give this information just to indicate that I'm not generally lazy or resistant to activity.  I can hill climb in a spinning class and dead lift in body pump with the best of them.  It's just running that's defeated me.  

For years, even when I used to go to spin class pretty much everyday religiously, my retort to people who talked to me about running was "I get angry even if I have to run for the bus".  But last November, I tried to turn over a new leaf, to free my mind and allow myself to enjoy all these wonderful benefits running fans regaled me with.  Truth be told, I also wanted to shift a few pounds.

So, I diligently began running at least 6 mornings a week, getting up at 5.45am to pound the pavements and then work my way around the local park.  When it got too cold, I moved to the treadmill.  The longest amount of time I ever managed was 1 hour and 10 minutes, the furthest distance 8km.  I tried interval training, running different routes, the same route, different times of the day. 

And I hated every minute.  No my mind wasn't free to run wild - I was mind-numbingly bored and clock-watching, wondering how what I was certain was 5 minutes was actually only about 2 minutes 38 seconds.  

I don't care that there are no barriers to entry and everyone can join in - that's the same for countless other cheap exercises when you can't afford the gym like a fitness video, skipping rope or a kettle ball.  

No, I don't enjoying dreading a hard session, then feeling elated after I've "nailed it" - it's the same kind of stress and panic I can get at the office or through the academic achievements I'm still working on.  

No, I didn't feel upset about having to miss a run - I felt guilty; so much so that I ran with an injured back and ended up with a herniated disc that put me out of action for 3 weeks.  

My belly didn't get flatter - my problem has always been one of the dreaded love handle rather than protrusion.  

And lastly, but most importantly, no running didn't make me any happier.

When my chest hurt (rather than my legs as described by my runner friends), I turned to Google to see if I'm abnormal and what I could do to overcome this problem.  But it was reading <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/nina-barough-cbe/london-marathon-2015_b_7133680.html" target="_hplink">this blog</a> about walking the London Marathon that finally allowed me to just be free, to throw in the towel with no shame or regret.  It helped me see the benefits of walking, to be thankful that I'll (hopefully) avoid the injuries associated with running.

So, as I continue to like my friends' Facebook posts on how they've just completed another charity 10k or local half-marathon, their pictures of smiling faces and those numbered thingies they give you to put on your  T-shirt, I can finally accept that that won't be me one day.  It's okay not to like running.

The best in beauty and wellness from the award-winning team at Get The Gloss

I don't believe in crash diets, 'get-in-shape-in-two-weeks' guides, juice fasts or starving yourself. Who ever went on a two-week diet that worked? What we're interested in here at Get The Gloss is helping people to be the healthiest they possibly can, to learn new habits that will last a lifetime and to feel the incredible benefits that really focusing on your health can bring. We believe in tasty, healthy food, and exercising to make you strong, not skinny. With this in mind, we have created <a href="http://www.getthegloss.com/product/project-bikini-guide" target="_hplink">Project Bikini</a>, a guide that is not just for summer but for good.

I myself have been on an amazing health and fitness journey over the last four years, and the benefits have been SO huge I want to share it with everyone. Four years ago I was just coming through the fog of having two babies - my children were four and two at the time. I was. Just. Plain. Shattered. I was starting up Get The Gloss and commuting in and out of London from Oxfordshire and would wake every morning, my body and head feeling like it was filled with lead. I desperately wanted to feel better but wasn't sure how.  

Over a few glasses of wine one night, my fittest friend Ruth told me to exercise. Waking hungover the next morning, I made a commitment to myself that I would get fit. Properly fit. While I've never been overweight, I also had a very stubborn muffin top and a few post-baby tummy rolls that refused point-blankly to budge. So I started running because that's all I really knew to do at the time - I could barely run half a mile without stopping, gasping for breath, feeling like I'd be sick, but I persisted, and with the help of the book Run Fat Bitch Run by Ruth Field, I realised I could (if I went slow enough) do this. Within a month I was running 3 miles.

At the same time, a personal trainer called <a href="http://www.getthegloss.com/expert/steve-mellor" target="_hplink">Steve Mellor</a> from the company Freedom2Train moved into the offices opposite ours in London. Steve took me out training in Holland Park (he will never know how close to passing out I was) but the high I got from the first few sessions with him, and the feel-good factor of having the blood pumping round my body fast for the first time in years was addictive. I booked in for more sessions with Steve and kept going out exercising on my own, and very soon I started to see amazing results. Steve also advised me on what to eat around exercise to gain maximum results and I visited nutritional therapist <a href="http://www.getthegloss.com/expert/amelia-freer-nutritional-therapist" target="_hplink">Amelia Freer</a>, a columnist on Get The Gloss, author of bestseller Eat, Nourish, Glow and the woman who has <a href="http://www.getthegloss.com/news/sam-smith-attributes-impressive-weight-loss-to-amelia-freer" target="_hplink">slimmed down Sam Smith</a>.

Within a year I had lost 12% body fat and I could see stomach definition where I'd never had any - even before kids. Last year I competed in two triathlons and cycled round Ibiza. But the biggest surprise to me was the way being healthier made me feel, especially the fitness part. Fitness first and foremost is, for me, not about the way I look (although that's a huge benefit obviously), but it makes me feel amazing, invincible even - it keeps stress at bay and makes me feel vital, alive, able to cope with anything life throws at me. I feel strong in my body yes, but most importantly I feel strong in myself. Exercise reorders my brain, calms me, and stops the constant chattering to-do list, something which meditation for example never did. The same goes for healthy eating - when I eat well I feel great, and I'm being truthful when I say I haven't had so much as a sniffle in three years, so eating a low sugar diet and exercising well clearly really works when it comes to boosting immunity too.

So what have I done that I believe really works?

1. Eating a low sugar diet - I strongly believe that <a href="http://www.getthegloss.com/article/10-bad-things-you-never-knew-sugar-was-doing-to-your-body" target="_hplink">sugar is damaging in many ways</a>, contains nothing nutritious, makes us feel rough and contributes to many illnesses. I swear eating low sugar is the reason I haven't been ill for so long.

2. <a href="http://www.getthegloss.com/article/a-healthy-curiosity-the-hiit-high-intensity-interval-training-lowdown" target="_hplink">High intensity exercise</a> - I have trained with Steve Mellor twice a week every week (bar a few holidays) for over 3.5 years. I do a mixture of high intensity training (sprinting, weights, cycling, boxing) combined with resistance work - using your body as a weight or doing weights.

3. Eating fresh food - it makes total sense to me that we as human beings are designed to eat the food that was given to us on our planet naturally. Not cartoon coloured doughnuts, cheese in the shape of a string and turkey twizzlers serenading as poultry.

4. Consistency is key - I started seeing and feeling real change when I started exercising over three times a week. Two times is not really enough, and it's important to schedule exercise in and stick to it.

My love of health and <a href="http://www.getthegloss.com/listing/fitness-news-and-features" target="_hplink">fitness</a> has probably been a huge influence on the content we have put up on Get The Gloss over the years and I have learnt I'm not alone in my desire to feel and look better - our health content is some of the most popular on our site. A few years ago, soon after we launched Get The Gloss, we ran <a href="http://www.getthegloss.com/listing/project-bikini-get-bikini-ready-guide" target="_hplink">Project Bikini</a> - a collection of amazing nutrition and fitness articles from the very best health and fitness experts in the land  - and ever since it has been some our most popular content to date.

We also ran a survey on our readers earlier this year and 73% said they were motivated to tone up, 51% like their stomach the least, and 56% said they would feel self conscious putting on swimwear on holiday. So with this in mind, this year we decided to package up everything we have ever learnt about looking and feeling great into one easy-to-follow practical guide. 

Project Bikini is 70 pages of health advice that I know really works. It contains around 40 pages of expert nutritional advice, and 36 healthy but incredibly tasty recipes from nutritional therapist Zoe Stirling and Chef Nina Parker. Then there's a 12 week fitness plan devised by Nike ambassador and Crossfit advocate Joslyn Thompson-Rule which combines weekly resistance exercises to help you tone up, with blasts of cardio work that will help rev up your metabolism. There's also advice on everything from supplements to super boost your diet to superfoods to nourish you from the inside out, as well as recipes on how to make healthy snacks and advice on good fitness kit.

There's even help with <a href="http://www.getthegloss.com/article/12-ways-to-stay-motivated-to-keep-fit" target="_hplink">motivation and how to keep going</a> when all you want to do is devour an entire Victoria Sponge. We realise that no one is a saint - I love nothing more than cocktails with friends, a huge glass of wine on a Friday night or chocolate brownies with lashings of cream - I just don't have it every day.

I am also hugely passionate that health isn't just for summer, it's for life, therefore Project Bikini isn't just about looking good in your swimwear - It's something we will run on our site all year round. We called it Project Bikini because we wanted it to sound more fun than your average health and fitness guide; neither is Project Bikini about being skinny and it's certainly not scary. Research shows that women can feel incredibly intimidated in the gym for fear of getting things wrong, or being shown up in front of the regular weight lifters and crop top wearers, but Project Bikini is something everyone can do in the comfort of their own homes, no equipment required (apart from a set of small dumbbells). We wanted to create something that's easy, that you could fit into your life and not have to fit your life around.

I believe passionately that there is nothing more important in life than our health - without it we have nothing -  and our aim is to bring you all the very best advice in one nutritious nutshell. Focusing on my health has changed my life; I hope we can help you change yours, too.

Author, Speaker, TV Presenter and Burnout Expert

<strong>Our body and living/working environment communicates with us when we have been running on adrenaline for too long and need to slow down.  </strong>

Many common illnesses are an indication that our system has become overloaded with stress chemicals.  Yet, more often than not we over ride these signals and force ourselves to keep moving forward until we are physically forced to press pause and recover.  

Physical and emotional stress stimulates the central nervous system, in a similar way to some recreational drugs, creating the experience of a natural high. According to addiction specialist Jim Pfaus, 'stressors can also wake up the neural circuitry underlying wanting and craving - just like drugs do'.

<strong>Although stressful situations may give us an enjoyable short-term buzz, our bodies are not designed to handle excessive stress on an on-going basis.</strong>

In stressful situations when we override our intuition to rest, restore and replenish our bodies and force ourselves to run on reserves, we continuously trigger our primitive fight-or-flight response. This response has helped us handle stress since the days when our ancestors lived in caves and had to fight off or escape the attack of wild animals.

In the modern western world the threat of wild animals is no longer present, but our mind and body continue to handle stress by activating the same physiological response. Our brain therefore registers our boss yelling or the approach of a work deadline as if it were a lion - releasing adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol into the blood stream to help prepare our body to run or fight.

While this response helps us to be mentally alert and focus on problems at work, it can be counter-productive because we are often unable to exert ourselves physically in order to metabolise the corresponding surge of hormones sent to our muscles. 

University of Stanford Professor Robert Sapolsky PhD explains that constant triggering of the stress response system can lead to severe damage of various organ systems within the body including:

<strong>Failure to address on-going stress can result in burnout and in extreme cases death.</strong>

BBC TV Presenter Andrew Marr experienced a moment of enlightenment when he nearly lost his life due to the effects of overwork. He made his first television appearance in April 2013 after suffering a stroke early into the new year and shared publicly that he had 'been very, very heavily overworking' the year prior to his experience and was 'frankly lucky to be alive'.

In a brave, emotional interview with the Daily Mail newspaper, Marr shared that overwork must have been a key contributory factor to his stroke:

<em>I was working too hard. No one made me do it, that's just the way I am... I'm a gulper, a gobbler-down of life. I wolf experiences down and, that year, I pushed my body and my mind too hard and far.</em>

But if we push on regardless, further illness, accidents, breakages and break-downs are sure to follow until we stop, rest and reevaluate.

Common Indicators

<strong>If you have a dead plant on your desk take note.  The conscious act of replacing it and simultaneously choosing to prioritise self-care could save your life. </strong>  

Note from the author of <em>Burnout to Brilliance: Strategies for Sustainable Success</em>:

I had the great pleasure of meeting German film maker and photographer, Lukas Rapp at Corinthia Hotel in London for the UK launch of my book.  Lukas is working on a fascinating project titled "Blue Screen".  He chose the title because he cleverly noticed:

<em>Burnout is a signal you should stop what are you doing right now and think over, in the same way the function of the blue screen is to stop the operation system before it gets really harmed.</em>  

This summer he will be showcasing a series of photographs focusing on burnout syndrome, how it affects people and the opportunity it offers for them to transform their lives.  

<em>Life is moving at a pace that is no longer good for us.  Burnout is often described as a fashionable illness, but the reality looks different.  Corporate leaders and executives working 60+ hours have a huge responsibility and need to cope with large-scale stress. My project aims to share the stories of those who have been through burnout, to help a wider audience better understand how it can effect every one of us. If more CEOs would talk about their experience of burnout the taboo would be diminished and it would be easier for those suffering to speak out in public about its severity.  </em>Lukas Rapp, Film Maker and Photographer

<a href="http://lukasrapp.com/" target="_hplink">Lukas</a> is currently looking for volunteers to share their stories with him and help play a part in creating the much needed shift in global corporate culture, away from overwork and overwhelm, towards sustainability and wellbeing: lukas.m.rapp@gmail.com

Press Officer at Amnesty International UK

As the Premiership comes to another action-packed conclusion - or not - I imagine football fans' thoughts are turning to... actually, god knows what they're turning to. Not being an enthusiast of the precious art of booting a leather sphere around an overly-tended rectangle of grass (ha!), I wouldn't know.  It's probably the Champions League play-offs, or the actual Champions League (where all those extremely good non-British teams do their stuff), or something like the Africa Cup of Nations. Or maybe football types are already hankering after a bit of bona fide World Cup action, a tournament where England draw their opening qualifying game 0-0, lose the next one and need to not lose the final one (only to lose it).

Yes, the World Cup, there's nothing like it. And there are only 3,072 days left before the start of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. OK, I guessed that figure, but it's something like that. Seven-and-a-half years (now that it's being played in the winter). Obviously there's <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=10/news=2018-fifa-world-cup-russiatm-official-emblem-revealed-at-international-2462679.html" target="_hplink">Russia 2018</a> before that (which will be <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/21/russia-world-cup-2018-sepp-blatter-vladimir-putin-budget-costs-ukraine-expensive" target="_hplink">interesting</a> for numerous reasons), but Qatar's the one that people like me (non-football fans) are going on about.

The situation's clear enough: on top of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/10867863/Qatar-2022-World-Cup-bid-hit-by-fresh-allegations-of-corruption.html" target="_hplink">allegations of corruption</a> in the original bidding process, the big issue is the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_dark_side_of_migration_-_spotlight_on_qatars_construction_sector_ahead_of_the_world_cup.pdf" target="_hplink">exploitation and endangerment of thousands of migrant workers</a> building Qatar's football infrastructure. It's received acres (football field's worth?) of coverage and the Qatari authorities have, under pressure, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/14/qatar-reform-labout-laws-outcry-world-cup-slaves" target="_hplink">promised improvements</a>. Promised, but not delivered. Amnesty has just produced a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/sites/default/files/qatar_may_2015_briefing_formatted_final_version.pdf" target="_hplink">"scorecard"</a> of nine key areas that need urgent reform (things like whether workers' passports are confiscated, whether they're allowed to form a trade union, or whether the "kafala" employment system will still tie workers to specific employers) and marked the Qatari authorities on their performance since promises were made a year ago. Look away now if you don't want to know the score ...

It's a resounding defeat for the workers. In five areas there has been limited progress. In four areas there's been ... <em>nothing at all</em>. After all the pressure and all the promises.

In fact Qatar seems at least as determined to change <em>the story</em> as it is the reality. So it's been taking journalists on guided tours of newly-built accommodation buildings for migrant workers then reacting angrily when some of them try to break away from the tour parties to see what the not-so-new ones are like. Arresting a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/bbc-demands-explanation-for-arrest-of-crew-investigating-qatar-world-cup" target="_hplink">four-person BBC crew</a> for doing precisely this recently wasn't just a lumbering PR own goal, it reveals a mind-set which still doesn't seem to understand that hosting an international sporting event of this magnitude brings with it a lot of scrutiny.

If there's a touch of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village" target="_hplink">Potemkin village</a> about all this, I think it's because the Qatari authorities tend to mix a high-handed money-buys-everything-ness (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shard" target="_hplink">Shard</a>, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/qataris-pledge-to-expand-canary-wharf-10191231.html" target="_hplink">Canary Wharf</a>, expensive public relations company <a href="http://www.prweek.com/article/1306763/qatari-government-awards-wide-ranging-global-brief-portland" target="_hplink">Portland Communications</a>) and a streak of authoritarianism that - for example - finds it acceptable to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24612650" target="_hplink">sentence a poet to life imprisonment</a>.

Where all this is going is difficult to determine. Time is running out over meaningful reforms ahead of 2022. The TUC-affiliated <a href="http://playfairqatar.org.uk/" target="_hplink">Playfair Qatar</a> organisation calculates that at the present rate of worker deaths in Qatar, some 4,000 will have died by the time the first World Cup game kicks off in 2022 (or put it another way: that's the equivalent of 62 deaths for each game in one of Qatar's glitzy stadia). <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32777320" target="_hplink">Playfair and the ITUC and others</a> have been trying to create a little <a href="http://consumerist.com/2015/05/20/visa-coca-cola-respond-to-human-rights-concerns-about-qatar-world-cup-not-pulling-out-as-sponsors/" target="_hplink">moral pressur</a>e on big commercial sponsors like Adidas and Visa (not to mention well-known health-and-fitness-friendly companies like McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Budweiser).

And then there's Fifa itself, that old bogeyman of sporting governance. Fifa's current president Sepp Blatter seems all but deaf to entreaties to do more on things like labour standards (see Marina Hyde's latest savaging of Blatter <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/20/slave-deaths-qatar-world-cup-2022-fifa" target="_hplink">here</a>) and - away from Qatar - his recent proposal for a "peace match" between Israel and Palestine seems to me typical of the vacuousness of so many Fifa initiatives (the deeper reasons why football itself is indeed a political football for Palestinians are well explored by Harriet Salem <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/palestinians-bid-to-boot-israel-from-international-soccer-over-sporting-apartheid" target="_hplink">here</a>). Meanwhile, a recent attempt by a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/fifa-elections-only-one-candidate-makes-firm-pledge-tackle-human-rights-and" target="_hplink">coalition of campaigners</a> to procure pledges over human rights from those hoping to replace Blatter as Fifa president has met with only limited success. More own-goalery.

No, Qatar's deep-seated labour issues are going to take a lot of sorting out. Millions of overseas workers will continue to risk being cheated, underpaid, overworked, maimed through injury and even killed while they slog through their long hot days building the stadia and associated infrastructure for this football jamboree. Meanwhile, we're likely to get more and more puff stories about Qatar's "model" accommodation blocks and worker villages. Qatari ministers and PR companies will be singing from their same hymn sheet. If they all sing together, maybe they can blot out the bad news ...

Public Affairs Manager, Cicero Group

In May 2010, shortly after being appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne delivered his first major post-election speech to the CBI Annual Dinner, in which he set the course for the next five years, a private sector led recovery able to absorb the retrenchment of the state.

Fast forward five years and Osborne delivered a very different speech, in a different city. Using his first major speech following the Conservative election victory on 7 May, Osborne stood in front of an audience in Manchester and spoke about how the Government intends to build a Northern Powerhouse over the course of the new Parliament. The symbolism, as well as the content, is significant.

It is easy to be cynical about the Northern Powerhouse. Critics have already labelled it as tokenism, or an afterthought from the Conservative Party to appease concerns that it does not think beyond its traditional strongholds. But it is more than that. Furthermore, criticising the vision before it has even got off the ground is actually counter-productive in the long run.

On the tokenism charge, such criticism is unfair. Osborne first launched the Northern Powerhouse agenda back in August last year, again with a speech delivered in Manchester. Politicians are often criticised for launching a scheme or initiative only for it to fall by the way side. Osborne hasn't allowed that to happen with the Northern Powerhouse. 

During the Autumn Statement last year, Osborne mentioned Manchester a total number of six times during his speech. In contrast, London was mentioned only twice. Osborne followed his Autumn Statement announcement of devolving major new powers to Greater Manchester by reaching an agreement to allow Greater Manchester to keep 100% of the additional growth in local business rates at the Budget in March. 

Given that we know the Queen's Speech next week will contain a new City Devolution Bill, this will make it three major political events in a row which have contained initiatives to help develop the idea of the Northern Powerhouse. Even critics of Osborne must now realise he is committed to the idea.

This is not to say Osborne is not thinking about the real politick of his Northern Powerhouse agenda, he clearly is. The picture of the new electoral map on 8 May provided the clearest insight into Osborne's calculation; large waves of blue across England are broken by dense clusters of red across the North. There is little dispute that the Conservative brand still acts as an electoral disadvantage across large areas of Northern England. The Northern Powerhouse is Osborne's attempt at re-branding the party. Given that the Conservatives picked up three seats in Greater Manchester at the general election, it seems it could already be working.

Should Osborne be criticised for his efforts? I don't think so. Growing up in Lancashire I cannot remember a time when the North was the focus of so many positive news stories emanating from Whitehall. If a by-product of the Northern Powerhouse is a more competitive political environment, one where Labour is in genuine competition with the Conservative Party, then in an odd way it could be in Labour's long term interest too.

A lack of competition in any environment can lead to stagnation, or worse, complacency. Large urban areas in the North vote Labour because they have traditionally identified as Labour, in as much a cultural as political way. Identity comes about through a sense of belonging. Sadly for Labour as shown by the recent general election, this sense of belonging has been challenged by the rise of UKIP. Too many traditional Labour voters have felt abandoned by the party, the left behind generation in a global race.

The Northern Powerhouse agenda caught Labour on the back foot. For example, the party opposed greater devolved powers over health spending, before making a u-turn when the local party in Manchester rejected the criticisms levied from head office in London. Labour now faces the prospect of an increasing electoral challenge from the Conservatives as a result of the Northern Powerhouse agenda, and from UKIP as a result of voters who feel Labour no longer understands their concerns.

This is ultimately why people of all political persuasions should support the Northern Powerhouse agenda. The enthusiasm demonstrated for it in places like Manchester means that Labour will have to respond and formulate new ideas to boost economic growth in the North. This new cities agenda offers space for innovative, collaborative and inclusive ideas, changing the way cities are governed and how the people who live in them can benefit as a result. Labour should embrace this challenge.

A healthy debate about how to address the geographic imbalance in Britain's economy, lifting the burden off the shoulders of London, has the potential to be an exciting one over the next five years. There will undoubtedly be issues and implementation problems along the way in creating the Northern Powerhouse, but these should not detract, as doing nothing is simply not an option.
